🔹 STEP 1 – Open your project folder

Go to your Desktop.

Open the folder:
👉 campus-portal

Inside you should see:

backend

campus-portal-frontend

🔹 STEP 2 – Start VS Code in the project

Right–click on the campus-portal folder.

Click “Open with Code” (or open VS Code and do File → Open Folder… → select campus-portal).

You should now see both folders (backend, campus-portal-frontend) in the VS Code Explorer.

🔹 STEP 3 – Start MongoDB

If you installed MongoDB as a Windows service (default), it usually starts automatically.

To be safe:

Press Windows key, type “Services”, open Services app.

Scroll and look for: MongoDB or MongoDB Server.

Make sure its Status = Running.

If not, right-click → Start.

(You don’t need to open MongoDB Compass unless you want to view data.)

🔹 STEP 4 – Start the Backend Server

In VS Code:

Open a new terminal:

Terminal → New Terminal

Make sure the path at the bottom shows:

C:\Users\Nitin\Desktop\campus-portal>


Go into the backend folder:

cd backend


Start the Node backend:

npm run dev


You should see something like:

[nodemon] starting `node server.js`
Server running on http://localhost:4000
MongoDB connected


✅ Leave this terminal running. Do NOT close it.

🔹 STEP 5 – Start the Angular Frontend

Now we open another terminal for the frontend.

In VS Code, click:

Terminal → New Terminal (this opens second terminal).

Make sure path is:

C:\Users\Nitin\Desktop\campus-portal>


Go into the Angular folder:

cd campus-portal-frontend


Run Angular dev server:

ng serve --open


This will compile the Angular app.

When done, it will automatically open your browser at:
👉 http://localhost:4200

If it doesn’t auto-open, just manually type http://localhost:4200 in your browser.

🔹 STEP 6 – Use your app

Now you should be able to:

Login with your admin credentials.

Go to Dashboard.

Navigate to:

Admissions

Placements

Cultural Events

All previous data should still be there in MongoDB (unless you deleted it).
